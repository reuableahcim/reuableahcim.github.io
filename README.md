# Welcome to The Virtuous Graph

## Graph as Code; Code as Graph

Our motto represents our vision of programming: taking a graph-centric approach to programming itself - to visualize the program as a graph and ultimately to modify a graph to modify a program.

Graphs come from many sources and are manifested in many forms.  While we contend code is itself a graph, in terms of data, the most common source by far are spreadsheets.  Manifesting spreadsheets as graphs include the pure visualization, our favorite being 3D, and the operational, our preferred choice unquestionably being the Labeled Property Graph from Neo4j.
